    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>After searching everywhere for a Uzbek plov (lamb and rice pilaf) recipe to recreate an amazing dish I tried at a Middle Eastern restaurant, I decided to try making this myself. Though not authentic, it still is amazing. Enjoy!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>4 whole heads garlic</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless leg of lamb, cut into 3-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>5 large carrots, coarsely grated</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh barberries</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cumin seeds</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coriander seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>2 cups boiling water to cover</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Place basmati rice in a large bowl; cover with warm water and set aside. Wash whole heads garlic; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or large skillet over high heat until smoking. Add lamb; cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in onions; cook and stir until softened and browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in carrots; cook and stir until softened, about 10 minutes. Add barberries, cumin, coriander, and peppercorns; drop whole heads garlic into Dutch oven, stirring to evenly distribute. Reduce heat to medium. Cover and cook 30 minutes.</li>
        <li> and drain basmati rice with hot water; add to Dutch oven in an even layer on top of lamb. Slowly pour in 2 cups boiling water. The rice should be covered with about 3/4-inch water. Do not stir. Season with salt; reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until rice is tender and liquid absorbed, about 20 minutes. Stir rice and lamb together; serve with whole garlic heads on top.</li>
    </ol>
