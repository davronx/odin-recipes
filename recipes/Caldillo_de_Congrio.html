        <li>Season with salt and the lemon juice.
        </li>
        <li>Cover with a layer of carrots, then a layer of half the potatoes, then the onions and garlic, and the rest of the potatoes.
        </li>
        <li>Season with salt, pepper, and oregano.
        </li>
        <li>Pour in the wine, fish stock, and olive oil.

        <li>Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the potatoes and carrots are tender, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Serve in soup bowls accompanied by crusty bread and butter. With the addition of dessert, or cheese, this makes a splendid lunch or dinner.
